in case ascending polling from latest already-processed tx id should not work,
e.g. due to perhaps tx order not being fixed (before + after finalizing), here are some notes on how to work with
polling in a desc direction then:

// adjust item limit dynamically...
// 25-50% redundant tx pages fetching is probably fine?
// should aim for fetching all relevant tx & changes in 95% of calls? 99%?
// estimate tx/s
// based on last 60s of txs? plus "spikiness" aka p95/p99 max
// increase query limit 10x more readily than decrease it?
// if didn't get all new tx + the last known one, launch a poll-based catch-up future with higher query limit
//	qlimit can be based on estimate tx/s, but higher "safety multiplier" since we want to mitigate further delay

we'd also need to keep track of all tx ids we've seen, collect them into a "checkpoint-cache", then on cp completion
flush all tx ids from the cache that we know are part of that cp
